# Axiania RPG formerly Asiania RPG

Axiania RPG formerly Asiania RPG written/modified/updated by Daryl. Asiania started as a pretty basic script
using a free to use balkan script as its base. After almost a year and a half of editing, updating, modifying;
the gamemode is now in very stable stage with barely any bug. The base script had a very poor naming
of variables, I kept changing them whenever I had extra time though still there are some non-translated variables.

The purpose of Asiania was to replicate Valrise Roleplay and I have to say I succeeded in replicating
almost 90 percent of Valrise. We have some extra features that they lack and they might have a few features that
we lack but the important part is already done. You are free to use the script however to like though the credits
should be given to Daryl and Truman (for a few extra touches with crates system).

# How to use

We have provided the database without passwords, serials and IP addresses of players. You can set yourself as an Owner
by setting your admin_lvl field to 7 in users table. Import asiania.sql to your database and update your credentials 
in scriptfiles > Mysql.ini. It is recommended to edit the gamemode with sublime text to avoid issues. We won't provide
any compiler or editor related help. Use the compiler version provided in the pawno folder with sublime text.
