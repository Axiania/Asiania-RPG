# Description

Axiania RPG formerly Asiania RPG written/modified/updated by Daryl. Asiania started as a pretty basic script
using a free to use balkan script as its base. After almost a year and a half of editing, updating, modifying;
the gamemode is now in very stable stage with barely any bug. The base script had a very poor naming
of variables, I kept changing them whenever I had extra time though still there are some non-translated variables.

The purpose of Asiania was to replicate Valrise Roleplay and I have to say I succeeded in replicating
almost 90 percent of Valrise. We have some extra features that they lack and they might have a few features that
we lack but the important part is already done. You are free to use the script however you like though the credits
should be given to Daryl.

Asiania RPG reached 100 players at its first release and had a stable playerbase of 40-50 for a few months. After that
the playerbase started declining so we decided to revamp the server. We closed the server and revamped it by adding
a lot of new features. The second release came after a few months and it was successful again. We reached 80+ players
on the second release and had a steady playerbase of 40+ for another few months but due to management issues players
started leaving and we had to close again.

After closing it for the third time, we decided to sell the server and found a buyer who paid well but later he decided 
that he wanted to quit San Andreas Multiplayer. Most of the cash was refunded and the script came back to the
original owner. Right now the gamemode is in a very stable stage with no known bugs or issues. You can host it
on a low-end VPS. I ran it on my OVH VPS with 2GB ram for almost a year. The server used 800 MB of ram at its peak.

# How to use

You can set yourself as an Owner by setting your admin_lvl field to 7 in accounts table. Import asiania.sql to your database and update your credentials 
in scriptfiles > Mysql.ini. It is recommended to edit the gamemode with sublime text to avoid issues. We won't provide
any compiler or editor related help. Use the compiler version provided in the pawno folder with sublime text.
