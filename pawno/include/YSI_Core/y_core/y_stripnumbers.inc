 *  Description
 * </section>
 *  Removes tag overrides which are actually numbers.  This allows for:
 *
 *      uvar g_a[MAX_PLAYERS][E_SOME_ENUM];
 *      uvar g_b[MAX_PLAYERS][42];
 *
 *  Without stripping you would end with code doing "42:0" or getting a tag
 *  mismatch on "E_SOME_ENUM", both of which are problems.
