 *  This holds the colour information that used to be part of the text system
 *  but which is far more useful than just for text.  This now supports the full
 *  set of X11 colours, both by name and by definition.  You can also define
 *  your own if you so choose (up to 32 - should be enough given that this
 *  includes the X11 colours).
